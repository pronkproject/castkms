# VM testing

This is the operational guide for the QEMU/KVM test guest. Use it when the
host cannot load an unsigned module, or when you want a clean kernel that
matches the VKMS baseline in `UPSTREAM.md`.

Under the hood it uses a checksum-pinned Fedora 45 cloud image, a qcow2
overlay, a dedicated local SSH key, QEMU user networking, and the Fedora
`7.2.0-61.fc45.x86_64` kernel built from the source baseline in
`UPSTREAM.md`. QEMU boots with ordinary BIOS firmware, so the guest does not
enforce Secure Boot module signatures, which is what lets it load the
unsigned module. Userspace packages are resolved from the Fedora repositories
when an overlay is provisioned; every run records the exact installed NEVRAs
in `guest-packages.txt`, plus the smaller toolchain and desktop package
manifests when applicable.

## Quick start

Provision the guest and run the smoke test:

```sh
./scripts/vm/castkms-vm provision
./scripts/vm/castkms-vm test
./scripts/vm/castkms-vm kunit-test
```

`provision` downloads the base image, creates a 30 GiB sparse overlay, boots
the guest, installs the pinned kernel and build tools, and reboots the guest
into that kernel. Re-running it is safe and idempotent.

`test` mirrors the current working tree into the guest and then:

1. runs the warning-enabled build matrix, all eleven KUnit suites, the live
   grant gate, and the userspace protocol and PipeWire tool builds;
2. verifies both modules' names, vermagic, dependencies, legacy strings, and
   exported symbols;
3. loads stock `vkms` and `castkms` together without default devices;
4. verifies independent `vkms` and `castkms` configfs roots;
5. creates a device through configfs and verifies topology removal safely
   disables and unplugs it before detaching configuration, including explicit
   ioctl and debugfs failures through file descriptors kept open across
   removal;
6. creates a default `castkms` DRM card with a color pipeline and writeback
   connector;
7. performs a bounded preferred-mode, vsynced page-flip test;
8. keeps CRC capture open across two writeback jobs, verifies both fences and
   output buffers, and requires fresh CRC records after writeback cleanup;
9. records `modetest`, `drm_info`, CRC, writeback, and lifecycle output;
10. unloads every module it loaded and verifies cleanup.

`kunit-test` builds the kernel-options-disabled fallback and all four
audio/CEC inclusion combinations, builds the KUnit module with `W=1`, loads
the Fedora KUnit support and CastKMS modules, and requires all eleven CastKMS
suites to pass. It then loads a normal two-output device and runs the live
grant-fd lifecycle gate, including cross-connector isolation. It rejects
kernel diagnostics from both phases, unloads the project modules, and copies
its build log, kernel logs, provenance, package manifests, and summary into
the default result directory. The standalone `make kunit` target remains
available for build-only coverage on a host that cannot load the modules.

The broader `test` command runs that fast gate first, archives its results
under `fast-gate/`, reuses its kernel build, then builds the userspace
protocol and PipeWire tools and runs the product scenarios. Setting
`CASTKMS_VM_FAST_GATE=skip` skips the fast preflight and performs one
warning-enabled production build instead. The CI product job uses that mode
because the workflow has a separate fast lane for the matrix, KUnit, and
grant checks.

## Continuous integration

The VM workflow runs on every pull request and push to `main`, and it can be
dispatched manually. It has three independent lanes:

- **Userspace / protocol and entrypoints**: `make check` on the host,
  including the EDID suite and every available CLI entrypoint.
- **Fast / KUnit and grant security**:
  `./scripts/vm/castkms-vm kunit-test`.
- **Product / full capture stack**:
  `CASTKMS_VM_FAST_GATE=skip ./scripts/vm/castkms-vm test`.

Results are copied to:

```text
~/.cache/castkms-vm/results/default/
```

Useful commands:

```sh
./scripts/vm/castkms-vm status
./scripts/vm/castkms-vm shell
./scripts/vm/castkms-vm logs
./scripts/vm/castkms-vm sync
./scripts/vm/castkms-vm stop
```

The default SSH forward is `127.0.0.1:22222`. Override it when running more
than one instance:

```sh
CASTKMS_VM_INSTANCE=second \
CASTKMS_VM_SSH_PORT=22223 \
./scripts/vm/castkms-vm provision
```

Tests that need discovery from a host network can add a second guest NIC while
retaining the user-network NIC used for SSH:

```sh
CASTKMS_VM_LAN_BRIDGE=virbr0 ./scripts/vm/castkms-vm start
```

The named host bridge must already exist and be allowed by QEMU's bridge-helper
policy. On a Wi-Fi host, use a routed or NATed bridge and reflect only the
required multicast-DNS services between that bridge and the Wi-Fi interface;
an ordinary Linux bridge cannot transparently carry a guest's second MAC over
most station-mode Wi-Fi connections. This option is deliberately opt-in so
kernel-only VM runs keep their isolated user network.

`reset` stops the guest and moves its instance directory into the state
directory's `archive/` folder before creating a fresh overlay. The downloaded
base image and SSH key are retained.

Each VM test copies its logs to
`~/.cache/castkms-vm/results/default/`. The fast test includes its KUnit,
live-grant, and kernel logs. After the product test has stopped its processes,
closed its files, and unloaded the modules, it saves the complete kernel log as
`product-dmesg.txt`. It fails if that log contains a kernel warning or bug, a
report of invalid memory use or undefined behavior, a reference-count failure,
a report that locks may be taken in an inconsistent order, or a DRM error.
When that check fails, the matching lines are also saved in
`product-kernel-errors.txt`. `kernel-debug-features.txt` records which relevant
instrumentation the running kernel actually enables. The pinned Fedora kernel
enables UBSAN but not KASAN, KCSAN, or lockdep, so those stronger diagnostics
require a separately built debug kernel rather than being implied by the log
pattern gate.

On a host that can load the modules, `make kunit` builds the test module
directly.

## Product scenarios

`test` performs module identification and teardown before running the selected
product work.

The product work is selectable:

```sh
CASTKMS_VM_SCENARIO=capture ./scripts/vm/castkms-vm test
```

The available scenarios are `configfs`, `capture`, `cursor`, and
`pipewire-audio`. The default `all` runs them in that order.

The guest harness keeps lifecycle setup and the single failure-safe cleanup
trap in `guest-smoke-test.sh`. Its product scenarios live in
`scripts/vm/guest-smoke/`, with an explicit ordered registry in `common.sh`.
`make check-smoke-modules` checks the registry and source layout without
starting the VM; the module contract is documented in that directory's
`README.md`.

**configfs** loads stock `vkms` and `castkms` together with no default
devices, checks that their configfs roots stay independent, and creates a
device through configfs. It also confirms that removing a topology disables
and unplugs the device before its configuration is detached, even when ioctl
and debugfs calls fail on file descriptors left open across the removal.

**capture** creates a default card with a color pipeline, writeback, and frame
checksums. It consumes a `0.10` grant fd, checks that an ordinary card fd
remains unauthorized, and exercises monitor attach, EDID, implicit and
explicit buffer synchronization, DMA-BUF fence reuse, completion metadata,
composed pixels, a vsynced `800x600` page-flip that advances the capture
mode generation, writeback overlapping an in-flight capture, and the
standalone CEC session test through a full-rights grant.

**cursor** checks cursor metadata and bitmap transitions on a grant-backed
capture stream.

**pipewire-audio** publishes a grant-backed PipeWire source, validates
delivered frames, disconnects the consumer so the source releases its
destination pool, reconnects a second consumer on a fresh CastKMS stream, and
checks PipeWire audio-sink discovery plus ALSA card creation, ELD, playback,
timestamps, and pause/resume when audio is available.

Device-backed capture, grant, grant-launcher, and CEC clients share the small
`castkms-test-drm` harness for driver identification, dumb framebuffers, and
capture stream/buffer protocol operations. Scenario runners keep only their
test-specific policy and sequencing.

## Grant lifetime test

The grant-specific kernel/UAPI tool can also be run independently after
loading the module:

```sh
sudo ./tools/castkms-grant-test /dev/dri/cardN CONNECTOR-ID
```

It proves the grant contract on a live card: an ordinary fd cannot capture, a
master can issue and pass a grant, missing rights are rejected, and a holder
can attach and capture. It also covers delegated-helper lifetime, master
drop/reacquire, residual-frame denial through CastKMS pixel-export paths,
capture-destination ownership, grant `fdinfo`, and revocation including
creator-close and final-holder cleanup.

## Graphical testing

The VM includes a virtio VGA device. Set `CASTKMS_VM_VNC_DISPLAY` before
starting it to expose a local-only VNC console; display `9` listens on TCP
port `5909`:

```sh
./scripts/vm/castkms-vm stop
CASTKMS_VM_VNC_DISPLAY=9 ./scripts/vm/castkms-vm start
```

GNOME/Mutter testing uses a separate `desktop` instance so the default
kernel-smoke guest stays minimal:

```sh
./scripts/vm/castkms-vm desktop-provision
./scripts/vm/castkms-vm desktop-test
```

Those commands default to instance `desktop`, SSH port `22223`, 8 GiB of
guest memory, and VNC display `9` (`127.0.0.1:5909`). Override them with the
same `CASTKMS_VM_*` variables used by the headless instance.

`desktop-provision` runs the ordinary kernel and toolchain install, then adds
GNOME Shell, Mutter, GDM, and Mesa GBM/software renderers, enables the
graphical target, and configures passwordless GDM autologin for the `castkms`
user. After reboot it synchronizes and builds the current tree, installs the
attachment service outside the home directory, and leaves `VirtualScreen`
attached. `desktop-start` boots an already provisioned desktop guest and
refreshes that runtime, while `desktop-attach` performs only the refresh on a
guest that is already running.

`desktop-test` loads `castkms` with a default disconnected virtual connector
and no extra planes or writeback, checks that the card's udev properties do
not carry `mutter-device-ignore`, restarts GDM so the session enumerates the
new KMS device, and waits for `org.gnome.Shell` and
`org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig`. `GetCurrentState` must not list the Virtual
connector until the attachment service runs; afterward, the connector must
appear.

Results are copied to `~/.cache/castkms-vm/results/desktop/`. Connect a VNC
client to port `5909` to inspect the running GNOME session after a successful
test.

Useful desktop lifecycle commands:

```sh
./scripts/vm/castkms-vm desktop-status
./scripts/vm/castkms-vm desktop-start
./scripts/vm/castkms-vm desktop-attach
./scripts/vm/castkms-vm desktop-shell
./scripts/vm/castkms-vm desktop-stop
```
